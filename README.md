# GradeCat

GradeCat is a personal project of mine which I've been planning for quite some time. I really hope to actually finish this, and take it to the end.

## About
GradeCat is an efficient, and easy-to-use grade management system for schools and educators. The reason behind this was to provide a place where teachers and students can interact, and manage grades/post assignments.

## Future updates
I plan to make several features in the future. Once the application is done, I plan to completely revamp the user interface into something much better, and revamp the backend as well. I also have plans for making a software version of GradeCat.

## Release Date
Things have just got started, so I plan to release GradeCat at around April 2021.
